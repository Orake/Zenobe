This project contains an implementation of an EV charging manager in Java. 
The EVChargingManager class provides a method, getChargeDifferential(), that manages the charging 
and discharging of EVs based on the time of day, EV type, and current charge.

Running the Code

To run the code, you can create an instance of the EVChargingManager class and call the getChargeDifferential() method
with the appropriate arguments

Running the Tests

To run the tests, you can use the TestNG testing framework. The tests are located in the EVChargingManagerTest class in the
test directory.

In order to run the framework we need;
	Java 1.8
	Maven
	IDE
  TestNG

This framework has only been tested on a Mac, in Windows it’s supposed to be run.
